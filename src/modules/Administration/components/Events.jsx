        Events are actions or occurrences that happen within a system or application. They can be triggered by user interactions, system changes, or external factors. Events can be used to initiate workflows, send notifications, or update data in real-time.
        Events can be categorized into different types, such as system events, user events, and application events. Each type of event can have its own set of properties and attributes that define its characteristics and behavior.
